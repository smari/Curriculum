# About

Curriculum is a web-based application written in Python/Django for creating and managing curriculum in educational systems. It is intended for curricula-based communication between educational institutions and the ministry of education or some similar organization.

Curriculum is initally developed for the Icelandic ministry of education, culture and science but as a free and open source software it could be useful in other countries or for other organizational units as well.

Curriculum is released under The GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL), version 3 or later.
